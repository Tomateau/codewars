    "\n",
    "A famous casino is suddenly faced with a sharp decline of their revenues. They decide to offer Texas hold'em also online. Can you help them by writing an algorithm that can rank poker hands?\n",

    "Each card consists of two characters, where<br />\n",

    "The second character represents the suit: S(pades), H(earts), D(iamonds), C(lubs)<br />\n",
    "A space is used as card separator between cards<br />\n",
    "The result of your poker hand compare can be one of these 3 options:<br />\n",

    "        Four of a Kind is 34, but that's still less than 10 + 13 + 15 = 38, so Straight Flushes always dominate.\n",

    "        This acts as a tie-breaker when HAND_SCORE == HAND_SCORE. Because of how this is sorted, it will compare the value of\n",
    "        the 3 identical values in a Full House before the 2 identical values. This elegantly works for all High Card, Pair, etc.\n",
